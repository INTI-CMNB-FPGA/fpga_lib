Library of utilities such as cores, procedures and functions, commonly shared between FPGA projects.

Is developed and mantained by the *FPGA team* of the *Centre of Nano and Microelectronics* [CMNB](http://www.inti.gob.ar/microynanoelectronica/) of the *National Institute of Industrial Technology* [INTI](http://www.inti.gob.ar/).

We try to develop portable code to be vendor independant. The main used HDL language is VHDL (93) and we use [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) to simulate.
* Documentation is under construction.
* Verilog (2001) code and iVerilog (Icarus) support will be added.
