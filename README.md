# FPGA Lib

Library of HDL snippets (such as cores, procedures and functions) commonly shared between FPGA
projects.

This project is mainly developed and mantained by the *FPGA team* of the
*Centre of Nano and Microelectronics* [CMNB](http://www.inti.gob.ar/microynanoelectronica/)
of the *National Institute of Industrial Technology* [INTI](http://www.inti.gob.ar/).
Contributions are welcome.

* We try to develop portable code to be vendor independant.
* The main used HDL language is VHDL (93) and we use [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) to simulate.
  You can read [vhdl/README.md](vhdl/README.md) for more details.
* Verilog (2001) code and iVerilog [Icarus](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) support will be added.
* Documentation is under construction.
