# FPGA Lib

Library of HDL snippets (such as cores, procedures and functions) commonly shared between FPGA projects.

This project is mainly developed and mantained by the *FPGA division* of the
*Centre of Nano and Microelectronics* [CMNB](http://www.inti.gob.ar/microynanoelectronica/)
of the *National Institute of Industrial Technology* [INTI](http://www.inti.gob.ar/).
Contributions are welcome.

* We try to develop portable code to be vendor independant.
* The main used HDL is VHDL (93) and we use [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) to simulate.
  You can read [vhdl/README.md](vhdl/README.md) for more details.
* Verilog (2001) code and iVerilog [Icarus](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) support will be added.
* We are adding [CocoTB](https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb) for simulations under [testbench](testbench).
* Documentation is under construction.
  You can see an HTML version [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib/blob/master/doc/html/index.html).
