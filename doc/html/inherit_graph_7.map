In synchronous mode, the clock in both sides, write and read, must be the same. In asynchronous mode, the clocks can be unrelated and so extra resources for CDC are employed. There are full, almost full and overflow indications in the Write side and empty, almost empty and underflow indications in the Read side. The almost empty and full indications can be configured by generics, as the offset to reach empty and full respectively. " alt="" coords="323,31,376,57"/>
